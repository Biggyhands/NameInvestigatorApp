# NameInvestigatorApp
NameInvestigatorApp is a React application that integrates APIs to determine the possible origin of a name (full or first name only). The app displays the country of origin with its flag, and upon clicking the flag, a themed GIF is loaded. This project demonstrates the use of APIs, React state management, and interactive information visualization.

The assets and APIs used in this project are **NOT** my original work. This application was developed as a learning exercise to practice and demonstrate my abilities in web development.

**Features**:

*   **Search:** Allows users to search for the origin of a name by entering the full name, only the first name, or only the last name.
*   **Name Details:** Displays the possible country of origin of the searched name, along with the estimated probability of that being the correct origin.
*   **Country Flag:** Shows the flag of the country corresponding to the name's origin.
*   **Country Detail:** Allows the user to click on the flag to obtain a random GIF related to that country.
*   **Styling:** Basic responsive design using CSS, adapting to different screen sizes.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for cases where the APIs fail or do not return information.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Style sheet language for designing the appearance of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for adding interactivity and logic to the web page.
- **React:** Library for building the user interface with reusable components.
- **APIs:**
*   **[Namsor API](https://namsor.app/):** Used to determine the probable country of origin of a given name.
*   **[Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/):** Used to fetch relevant GIFs related to the identified country.
*   **[Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/):** Used to obtain country flags and information.

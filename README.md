# NameInvestigatorApp
NameInvestigatorApp is a React application that integrates APIs to determine the possible origin of a name (full or first name only). The app displays the country of origin with its flag, and upon clicking the flag, a themed GIF is loaded. This project demonstrates the use of APIs, React state management, and interactive information visualization.

The assets and APIs used in this project are **NOT** my original work. This application was developed as a learning exercise to practice and demonstrate my abilities in web development.
